# Hi, I'm Alina 👋

I’m an economics student, analyst, and data storyteller who loves turning messy information into clear insights. My experience spans investment research, data analytics, financial modeling, and operational problem-solving. I’ve analyzed tech companies preparing for IPOs, built SQL-powered dashboards from scratch during an internship, and led teams in national business competitions—often with more spreadsheets open than I’d like to admit.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **finance × data × operations**. Whether it’s evaluating market conditions, cleaning and visualizing large datasets, or designing workflows that actually make people’s lives easier, I’m drawn to challenges that require both analytical depth and practical execution.

Outside of academics, I’ve led marketing strategy for student organizations (and grew engagement by 200%), guided students at UCSD’s Academic Integrity Office, and worked on economic-history mapping projects using provincial-level datasets. I also love photography and often take graduation portraits for friends—because good framing matters in both pictures and research.
